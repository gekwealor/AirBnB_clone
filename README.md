We will need to clone the repository of the project from our Github.

git clone https://github.com/gekwealor/AirBnB_clone.git
git clone https://github.com/ivy153/AirBnB_clone.git

When the cloning is completed, a folder named AirBnB_clone will be available. It will contain various files that will allow the programs to work.
